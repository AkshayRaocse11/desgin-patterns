# Design Patterns in JavaScript

This repository contains examples of commonly used design patterns in JavaScript, designed to help developers understand and implement these patterns in their projects.

## Singleton Pattern - ðŸ”— **Reference:** [Singleton Pattern Code](singletonPattern/counter.js)
The Singleton pattern restricts the instantiation of a class to a single instance. It is useful when exactly one object is needed to coordinate actions across a system.

### Advantages
- **Controlled Access to a Single Instance**: Ensures that there is controlled access to the sole instance, making it easier to manage resources.
- **Reduced Memory Usage**: By ensuring only one instance is created, memory usage is optimized, especially in cases where the instance creation is resource-heavy.
- **Global Access Point**: Provides a global point of access, making it straightforward to manage shared resources or states.

### Disadvantages
- **Hidden Dependencies**: The Singleton pattern can introduce hidden dependencies in the code, making it harder to test and understand.
- **Testing Challenges**: Singleton classes can complicate unit testing, as it may be difficult to mock or reset their state.
- **Potential for Unwanted Global State**: Misuse of Singletons can lead to problems related to global state management and unpredictable behavior in larger systems.
- **Concurrency Issues**: In a multi-threaded environment, careful implementation is required to avoid synchronization problems.

## Proxy Pattern - ðŸ”— **Reference:** [Proxy Pattern Code](proxyPattern/FileProxy.js)
With a Proxy object, we get more control over the interactions with certain objects. A proxy object can determine the behavior whenever weâ€™re interacting with the object, for example when weâ€™re getting a value, or setting a value.

Generally speaking, a proxy means a stand-in for someone else. Instead of speaking to that person directly, youâ€™ll speak to the proxy person who will represent the person you were trying to reach. The same happens in JavaScript: instead of interacting with the target object directly, weâ€™ll interact with the Proxy object.

**Tradeoffs**
Proxies are a powerful way to add control over the behavior of an object. A proxy can have various use-cases: it can help with validation, formatting, notifications, or debugging.
Overusing the Proxy object or performing heavy operations on each handler method invocation can easily affect the performance of your application negatively. Itâ€™s best to not use proxies for performance-critical code.

**Advantages**:
    Access Control: Enables fine-grained access control to sensitive resources by checking user roles before performing operations.
    Decoupling: Separates the access control logic from the real object, simplifying the management of permissions.
    Security: Helps to secure critical operations by preventing unauthorized access based on roles or permissions.
    Centralized Authorization: With the Proxy, authorization logic can be centralized, making it easier to manage and update.
**Disadvantages**:
    Performance Overhead: Introducing a proxy adds an additional layer of abstraction, which can increase the time it takes to perform the actual operation.
    Complexity: In some cases, proxies can increase the complexity of the codebase, especially if the proxy logic becomes too intricate.
    Potential for Misuse: If not properly implemented, proxies may lead to over-complication in scenarios where access control is not necessary.
