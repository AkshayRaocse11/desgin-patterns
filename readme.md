## Singleton Pattern - ðŸ”— **Reference:** [Singleton Pattern Code](singletonPattern/counter.js)
The Singleton pattern restricts the instantiation of a class to a single instance. It is useful when exactly one object is needed to coordinate actions across a system.

### Advantages
- **Controlled Access to a Single Instance**: Ensures that there is controlled access to the sole instance, making it easier to manage resources.
- **Reduced Memory Usage**: By ensuring only one instance is created, memory usage is optimized, especially in cases where the instance creation is resource-heavy.
- **Global Access Point**: Provides a global point of access, making it straightforward to manage shared resources or states.

### Disadvantages
- **Hidden Dependencies**: The Singleton pattern can introduce hidden dependencies in the code, making it harder to test and understand.
- **Testing Challenges**: Singleton classes can complicate unit testing, as it may be difficult to mock or reset their state.
- **Potential for Unwanted Global State**: Misuse of Singletons can lead to problems related to global state management and unpredictable behavior in larger systems.
- **Concurrency Issues**: In a multi-threaded environment, careful implementation is required to avoid synchronization problems.
